## üìù Introduction

Linear algebra is the study of vectors, vector spaces, linear mappings, and systems of linear equations. This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that cover a wide range of topics, including:

- **Vector and Matrix Operations**: Basics of vectors, matrices, and operations on them.
- **Determinants and Inverses**: Understanding how to compute determinants and inverses of matrices.
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Deep dive into eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and their significance.
- **Linear Transformations**: How linear transformations are represented and applied in various fields.
- **Applications in Data Science**: Practical examples of linear algebra in machine learning and data science.

By working through these notebooks, you'll develop a solid foundation in linear algebra and learn how to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.
